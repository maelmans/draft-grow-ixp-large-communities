        BPG Large Communities applications for IXP Route Servers
                   draft-adkp-grow-ixpcommunities-00

Abstract

   This document presents suggestions for the use of BPG Large
   Communities [RFC8092] at Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) based on
   operational experiences from IXP members this document suggests
   catergories of communities.  Any IXP operator or IXP member can
   consider using these communities.  The document specifically focusses
   on Route Server [RFC7947] deployments in IXP context [RFC7948].

Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all

1.  Introduction

   This document presents suggestions for the use of BPG Large
   Communities [RFC8092] for IXP operators and members using the BGP-4
   [RFC4271] protocol.  It adds specific suggestions for the operators
   and members of IXPs deploying BGP Large Communities as suggested in
   [RFC8195].

2.  Suggested Large BGP Community Standard List

   This list proposes a standard to use in IXP operations for the use of
   BGP Large Communities.  It was first published at the EURO-IX website
   [EURO-IX].

   The tables below provide a per 'section' divided overview of Large
   Community usage.
